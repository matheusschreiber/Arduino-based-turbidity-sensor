## Project Description
> As a real turbidity sensor (which is sold in electronics stores) usually has a high price, the idea of this project came to replace such equipment with lower-priced ones and obtain a similar result. Consisting basically of an Arduino UNO and an LDR resistor, the project also becomes more customizable depending on the purpose for which it is intended.

## How to build it
> Materials
<ul>
    <li>1 Box</li>
    <li>cup holder</li>
    <li>Flashlight</li>
    <li>Arduino UNO</li>
    <li>Protoboard</li>
    <li>1 LDR resistor</li>
    <li>5 led's</li>
    <li>5 x ohms resistors</li>
    <li>1 x ohm resistor</li>
    <li>Jumpers</li>
</ul>

> Mounting
<ul>
    <li>First you have to make the cuts in the box to fit the elements and then place them in the right position, with the LDR just below the cup. Afterwards, the necessary connections of the components are made on the protoboad, always remembering to position the LEDs in order to facilitate their visualization. Finally, the Arduino is connected to the computer to pass the code and put the system into running. To use, just place your water sample in the appropriate place and see the result based on the color of the LEDs.</li>
